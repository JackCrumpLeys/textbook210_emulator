- AUTO BREAKPOINT AT HALT (So it is easy to see registers before os messes with them)
- FIX CONTROL OUT OF PANE
- MAKE IO PANE ACTULLY GOOD (IT SUCKS)
- UPDATE HELP
- ADD SUPPORT FOR TERMINAL CONTROL AND ASCII ESCAPES
- MAKE LIGHT MODE LESS ASS
- I THINK BREAK POINTS ARE BROKEN
  - MOVE BREAKPOints to memory veiwer
- Make memory veiwer less ass
  - right now we decompile very memory adress every frame, not good for cpu!
  - make offsets use labels when relevant
- Make a proper parser
  - most of the bugs with the curren parser come from the fact it is a bunch of string matching. We dont need a tree for assembly but tokeniztion would be good
- add some other devices
  - pixel display
  - file system (higher leval then just writing storage I think)
  - ETC
- cool tools that arn just emulator
  - single instruction compiler/decompiler
  - IDFK
- a more feture full os
  - OS building tool where users can edit just one trap (to implement os activity wihout having to worry much about internals)
  - utility traps for math (mult, mod, div)
    - OS managed 16 bit float types?
- a table for user to define shorthand mappings like puts etc
