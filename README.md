# LC-3 Emulator & UoA CompSci 210 tools
## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Full LC-3 Emulation
- Complete implementation of all LC-3 instructions
- Cycle-accurate simulation with visible micro-operations
- Privilege level support (User/Supervisor mode)
- Memory protection and exceptions handling
- Device I/O through keyboard and display registers

### 🔍 Debugging Capabilities
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Execute one instruction or micro-operation at a time
- **CPU State Visualization**: See the processor cycle in action with color-coded state transitions
- **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints at specific memory addresses
- **Machine Code Display**: View the assembled binary representation of your program

### 🧰 Additional Tools
- **Base Converter**: Convert between different number bases (binary, decimal, hex)
- **Terminal I/O**: Interact with your programs through a virtual terminal
- **Alot more to be done here**: Email ideas to jackcrumpleys@gmail.com!! (I will likely do everything relevant that is emailed to me)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Online Version

The stable release can be found at [210tools.github.io](https://210tools.github.io).

A version of the website that is always up to date as long as the code compiles can be found [here](https://jackcrumpleys.github.io/textbook210_emulator/).

To ensure you're using the latest version, press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) to force a browser cache reload.

### Offline Use

You can download the standalone application for offline use from the [releases page](https://github.com/JackCrumpLeys/textbook210_emulator/releases/tag/main). (Note that this is the bleeding edge and might be buggy)

## 📝 Quick Guide

Every small task uses different panes, you can drag pains around by their top tab. Here is the basics:

1. **Write Code**: Use the Editor pane to write your LC-3 assembly code
2. **Compile**: Click "Reset & Compile" to assemble your program \[Editor pane]
3. **Run**: Use the control buttons to: \[control pane]
   - "Run" - Execute continuously
   - "Pause" - Stop execution
   - "Step" - Execute one full instruction
   - "Small Step" - Execute one micro-operation
4. **Debug**: Use the Memory, Registers, and CPU State panes to inspect program state
5. **Set Breakpoints**: Click the 🛑 button next to a line in the Machine Code view (TODO: move this to memory pane)


### TODO: Add better help
**The handy help pane has infomation on each pane and LC3 in general**


## 📚 Educational Value

This emulator is specifically designed as an educational tool that makes the inner workings of a computer transparent:

- **Visualization of Abstract Concepts**: See normally invisible computer operations
- **Understanding State Transitions**: Follow data as it moves through the processor
- **Safe Experimentation**: Test ideas in a controlled environment
- **Immediate Feedback**: Directly observe the effects of your code

## 📋 Technical Details

The emulator implements:
- All standard LC-3 instructions
- Fetch-decode-execute cycle with visible micro-states
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Privilege levels and memory protection
- Trap routines for system services
- Exception handling
- Full OS support with a simple OS implementing everything the OS from the UOA COMPSCI-210 class

NOTE: The implementation of this emulator is based entirely on the 3rd edition of "Introduction to Computer Systems" by Yale n. patt and sanjay j. patel.
